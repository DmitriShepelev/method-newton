## Task description ##

> Implement an algorithm of the Newton method to calculate the root of the n-th degree (n ∈ N) from a real number (System.Double) with a given accuracy  `(] 0; epsilon[, 0 < epsilon < 1) `. The value of the epsilon constant is set in the configuration file.

*Topics -  loops, struct System.Double, equality for System.Double.*
